# Milestone 2 – AI Readability Dashboard & Security Enhancements

## Project Title
TextMorph – Advanced Text Summarization and Paraphrasing

## Description

In Milestone 2, we enhanced the existing authentication system by implementing OTP-based login verification, login attempt restriction, and an AI-powered Readability Dashboard.

The application now includes OTP authentication, an account lock mechanism, Admin and Chat pages, and a Readability Dashboard that analyzes text using standard readability metrics.

All features are fully integrated and tested within the TextMorph application.
