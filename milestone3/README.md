# Milestone 3

## Project Overview

This project is a **secure AI-powered text processing platform** that combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP) models with a secure authentication system**. The application allows users to analyze text readability, generate summaries, paraphrase content, and interact with an AI-powered interface through a web dashboard.

The system integrates **transformer-based language models, dataset augmentation techniques, and model fine-tuning** to improve the accuracy and performance of text processing tasks.

# Features Implemented

## 1. Secure Authentication System

The platform includes a **secure authentication mechanism** to protect user accounts.

### Features

- User registration and login  
- Password hashing using **bcrypt**  
- **JWT token-based authentication**  
- Email-based **OTP verification**  
- Password reset using **security questions**  
- Login **rate limiting** to prevent brute-force attacks  
- **Password history protection** to prevent reuse

## 2. Advanced Text Summarizer

The system provides an **AI-based summarization tool** capable of generating concise summaries from long text.

### Capabilities

- Handles **large text inputs**
- Works with **TXT and PDF files**
- Generates **concise summaries automatically**
- Integrated with **readability analysis**

### Models Used

- **BART**
- **PEGASUS**
- **T5**

These transformer models are designed for **high-quality text summarization tasks**.

---

## 3. Paraphrase Engine

The **paraphrase engine** rewrites sentences while preserving their original meaning.

### Key Benefits

- Improves readability  
- Generates alternate sentence structures  
- Helps **avoid plagiarism**

### Model Used

- **T5 Transformer Model**

The **T5 model treats NLP tasks as a text-to-text problem**, making it suitable for paraphrasing tasks.

---

## 4. Dataset Augmentation

To improve the training dataset, multiple **text augmentation techniques** were applied.

### Techniques Used

- Synonym replacement  
- Random word deletion  
- Sentence shuffling  
- Paraphrasing-based augmentation  

These methods **increase dataset diversity and help improve model generalization**.

---

## 5. Model Fine-Tuning

The transformer models were **fine-tuned on the project dataset** to improve task performance.

### Optimization Techniques Applied

- **4-bit / 8-bit model quantization**
- Efficient training pipeline
- Reduced memory usage

### Benefits

- Faster **inference speed**
- Reduced **computational requirements**
- Improved **summarization quality**

---

## 6. Readability Dashboard

The application includes a **readability analyzer** that evaluates the complexity of text.

### Metrics Included

- **Flesch Reading Ease**
- **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**
- **SMOG Index**
- **Gunning Fog Index**
- **Coleman-Liau Index**

### Additional Statistics Displayed

- Sentence count  
- Word count  
- Syllable count  
- Character count  
- Complex word count  

Results are visualized using **interactive charts**.

---

## 7. Improved User Interface

The user interface was enhanced to provide a **modern and user-friendly experience**.

### UI Improvements

- Dark themed dashboard  
- Sidebar navigation  
- Interactive charts  
- Clean layout and typography  
- Structured navigation between modules
